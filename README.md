[]I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
    []title
    []url link
    []description
    []rating (1-5) 
    
[]I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
[]All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
[]I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
[]Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
[]I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
[]I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
[]Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required
        title/url = required type = ’text'
        url = required —make sure to put in html input type = ‘url’  required
        url = should be a drop down menu 
        description = optional --
[]I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
